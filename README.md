# Code-Quiz-Game

# Installation
Download the file from github, then add it to a folder where you can open it by using VS (visual sutdio code),


# General Info
I created a quiz that contains several questions about coding, points are added after each question and information is displayed whether the person playing answered the question correctly or incorrectly.
At the end of the quiz, a table appears that saves all the results and names of the players, where there is also an option to return to the quiz and play again or delete all results.
This quiz was intended to demonstrate my coding skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


Here is my link to the quiz - https://michallaa.github.io/Code-Quiz-Game/
